<h3>Visual Communication and Design (VCD)</h3>

<p>I am a student at eastern Washington University studying Visual Communication and Design. I initially went to eastern because I got the opportunity to play volleyball there and I heard about the VCD program and thought it would be a great fit for my gaming and artistic passions. For the first three years I works extremely hard trying to balance volleyball and homework, when I finally realized VCD was not just my passion it was also my Future I made a huge decision not to play volleyball the next year. I have never enjoyed learning so much, and I am excited for two more years of extremely rewarding classes!</p>

<h3>Professional Objectives (required)</h3>

<p>I have taken a lot of different classes from typography to Figure Drawing and enjoyed all of them but nothing has interested me as much as the Web Design class I am taking now. I am not that far into the class, but the design and organizational aspects of html and css I am completely drawn to. I finally know what direction I want to go in the design world, Web Design. </p>
