			<h3>Visual Communication and Design (VCD)</h3>

			<p>	I am a student at Eastern Washington University studying Visual Communication and Design. I initially went to Eastern because I got the opportunity to play volleyball there and I heard about the VCD program and thought it would be a great fit for my gaming and artistic passions. For the first three years I worked extremely hard trying to balance volleyball and homework, when I finally realized VCD was not just my passion it was also my Future, I made a huge decision to not play volleyball the next year. I have never enjoyed learning so much, and I am excited for two more years of extremely rewarding classes!</p>

			<h3>Professional Objectives </h3>

			<p>I have taken lots of different classes from typography to Figure Drawing, and I have enjoyed all of them, but nothing has interested me as much as the Web Design class I am taking now does. I am not that far into the class, but the design and organizational aspects of html and css are my style and draw me in. I finally know what direction I want to go in the design world, Web Design </p>
